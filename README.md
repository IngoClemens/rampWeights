# rampWeights & weightsServer
Weight controller nodes for Autodesk Maya to control blend shape weights or weighted deformers for various effects.

Originally the plug-ins were part of the blend shape editor [SHAPES](http://www.braverabbit.com/shapes/). The open source release is intended to give people easier access to these nodes even without the editor.
