# rampWeights & weightsServer
Weight controller nodes for Autodesk Maya to control blend shape weights or weighted deformers for various effects.

Even though the tool is Open Source we appreciate if you would consider support for continued development via [Gumroad](https://braverabbit.gumroad.com/l/rampWeightsMaya)
Thank you!

Originally the plug-ins were part of the blend shape editor [SHAPES](http://www.braverabbit.com/shapes/). The separate release is intended to give easier access to these nodes even without the editor.
