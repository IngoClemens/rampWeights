### Description:

This folder contains the build environments for Linux, macOS and Windows.

The source files contained in these projects are not updated with every version.
When using the build environments it might be necessary to relace the contained source files with the master files from the parent source folder.

The build environments are only meant as a convenience measure.

**Linux**
The Linux repository only contains a make file and no specific IDE project.

**macOS**
The macOS respository contains a make file for command line building as well as a XCode project.

**Windows**
The Windows repository contains a Visual Studio Express 2013 project.
